The switching -surge withstand test shall consist of ten applications of both positive and \nnegative polarity switching -surge test waves having a front of 150 -350 micro -seconds and a tail of 2,500 \nto 4,000 microseconds without flashover .

Whenever possible, the switching surge withstand test voltage shall be as specified by the user. The \nswitching surge withstand test voltage should be the same as is specified for electrical apparatus at the \nterminations of the line. For example: for a rated voltage of 500kV dc, one user specifi cs a switching \nwithstand voltage of 1300 kV for electrical apparatus. The switching surge withstand test shall consist of \n10 applications of  both positive and negative polarity switching surge test waves with a crest voltage of \n1300 kV, and having a front of 150 -350 microseconds , and a tail of 1000 -4000 microseconds  without \nflashover. For the design voltage and or qualification voltage testing  where  the actual system parameters \nare not known, the switching surge withstand test shall consist of 10 applications of both positive  and \nnegative polarity switching surge waves with a crest voltage of 1300 kV and  having a front of 150 -350 \nmicroseconds  and a tail of 1000 -4000 microseconds  without flashover.  \n \n \nAppendage for Rated Line Voltage of 500 kV and Above  \n \nThe double -rated voltage and withstand voltages may be adjusted to meet the actual design requirements \n© 2021 SAIA – All Rights Reserved\nLicensed to AMP Calibration LLC user.

The maximum percent system voltage rise can be as  high \nas 30% depending on line conditions. For a 30% system voltage rise , this test would equal kV max + \n30% (kV max): that is 800 kV + 30% (800) = 1040 kV Line to Line 60 hertz or 600 kV Line to Ground \n60 hertz.  \nThe Two (2) Second  Withstand Test for the same system parameters would be equal to 1.9 x kV \nmax or 1.9 x 462 Line to Ground 60 hertz = 878 kV Line to Ground 60 hertz (rms).

In  order to establish meaningful safe \napproach distances, both the insulation level of the aerial device and the qualification level(s) of the \nplatform occupant(s) must be established.  \n \nDefinitions  \nInsulating Aerial Device:  An aerial device with dielectric components designed and tested to meet the \nspecific electrical insulating rating consistent with the manufacturer’s identification plate.  \n \nNon-insulating Aerial Device:  An aerial device having no specific electrical rating.  For purposes of \ndetermining Minimum Approach Distances, an insulating aerial device that is operating in an \nenvironment in which the voltages exceed those assigned to the device is considered non -insulating.  \n \nUnqualified Person:  A person who does not have approval to appr oach energized lines and apparatus \nand has received no significant training regarding the electrical hazards involved in the placing of an \naerial device, platform occupants , and their tools closer to energized lines and facilities than the \ndistances listed  in Table A below.  \n \nQualified Person  (for Purposes of Minimum Approach Distances) :  A person who has received \ntraining, understands and is conversant in the electrical hazards involved in the placing of an aerial \ndevice, platform occupants , and their tools  closer to energized lines and facilities than the distances \nlisted in Table A below, and has approval to perform the work.  \n \nNote:  This is an expansion to the “Qualified Person” definition in Section 3. It is designed to include the \nspecialized knowledge r equired for determination of Minimum Approach Distances.  \n \nTo be qualified, different levels of training and skill are required depending upon the work to be \naccomplished and the electrical hazards associated with that work.  Qualification levels range from the \nperson unqualified to work on utility lines and associated facilities, yet who is subjected to significant \nrisk of injury from electrical hazards in the performance of their work, to the level of a person who is \nqualified to work on, and in close proxi mity, to power utility lines and associated facilities.  \nQualified persons shall be trained and skilled in know ing the dangers involved and the methods to avoid \nthem.  Training shall be under the supervision of a person or persons qualified at that specific level or \nhigher. It shall be clear that the term “qualified” represents different levels of training and skill.  \n \nAn example of work requiring a lesser amount of training is an aerial device operator and/or platform \noccupant performing maintenance on a buil ding without any work objective relative to the energized \nconductors attached to the building.  Training, however, is required for this aerial device operator and \nplatform occupant(s) to know how to address those conductors.  \n© 2021 SAIA – All Rights Reserved\nLicensed to AMP Calibration LLC user.
